## About page (current)

H1: About

Paragraph 1:
At Robot Customers LLC, we work with companies building, selling, and marketing consumer robots to help them truly understand their customers — whether they’re enthusiastic about robots, unsure and on the fence, or even afraid and firmly against them.

Paragraph 2:
We do this through surveys, polls, and in-depth interviews that capture both numbers and stories. Our research shows how people think about robots, how they feel about using them, and how they plan to engage with them in everyday life.

Paragraph 3:
By listening to customers in this way, we give manufacturers, dealers, and related businesses the clarity they need to build better products and deliver experiences that people actually want.
